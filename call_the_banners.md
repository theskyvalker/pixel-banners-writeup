# Call the Banners

CtB started as a simple discord game and has blossomed into a battle that has spanned 5 seasons, has a Farcaster native version called Farcastles, and weâ€™re currently working on CtB: Onchain as part of the Realms Autonomous Worlds.

While the first iteration of the game will not, future updates to the game will have provisions for Pixel Banner holders in the way of boosts and buffs to attacks, coin accruing, and more. For an idea of how we incorporated the Painted Banners into CtB: Discord, please visit [ctb.bannersnft.com](https://ctb.bannersnft.com).
