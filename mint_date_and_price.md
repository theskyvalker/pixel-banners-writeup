# Mint Particulars
## Date & Time
The mint will be a 3-phase mint, with Phase 1 starting on March 6th at 12pm UTC The price is **free**!

## Price
However, you will be able to pay $LORDS to lock in traits. More on that in the following section.

Half of the $LORDS from a locked trait will go to the artist who designed it, and the other half will go into the Banners treasury to continue to expand the Banners project.

## Mechanics
There are 7 trait categories in Pixel Banners: Background, Pole, Bannerfield, Element, Top, Sides, and Over. When you start the mint process, you begin with 8 full re-rolls. Each re-roll shuffles all trait categories and presents a new Banner. At any time before you use up your 8 re-rolls, you can choose to mint your Pixel Banner for free.

If along the way you see a trait you really like but want to re-roll the others, you can lock that trait for 16 $LORDS (about $7.00 at todayâ€™s price. If you need to purchase lords, please visit avnu.fi).

You may unlock that trait and avoid paying the 16 $lords, but your trait will be re-rolled in the next round.

On your 7th round, if you decide you no longer want to lock the trait, you may unlock and perform a final random reroll and mint that Pixel Banner for free. If you choose not to, your wallet will lose one if its associated mint passes.
