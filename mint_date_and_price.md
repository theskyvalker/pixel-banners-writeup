# Mint Date and Price

A firm mint date is still TBD, but we are aiming for 1st week of March. The price is **free**!

However, you will be able to pay $LORDS to lock in traits. More on that in the following section.

Half of the $LORDS from a locked trait will go to the artist who designed it, and the other half will go into the Banners treasury to continue to expand the Banners project.
