# About Pixel Banners

Banners (for Adventurers) was founded in 2021 and has been a present force in the Lootverse ever since, bringing stories, art, and lore to every corner of the Realms. Pixel Banners is our second visual NFT project after the Painted Banners. 

Over 30 artists from across Web3 have come together to create 1200 unique traits that will make up the 9337 Pixel Banners. Why 9337? Well, there are 8000 Realms, and this project was inspired by the 1337 Skulls, one of the most innovative and forward-thinking projects in the space. 

This site is a trait explorer only. It will flip to a mint site when we launch. For now, you can explore all the traits, assemble hypothetical Banners, and share them on your socials.
